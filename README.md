# Wireframing

## Introduction

**Wireframing** is the process of creating a basic visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website or application. It focuses on the layout, structure, and placement of key elements, helping teams plan functionality and user interactions before adding design details like colors, images, or fonts.

## Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process

Wireframing is a critical step in the design process because:
- ✅ It translates abstract ideas into tangible visual structures.
- ✅ It helps identify usability issues early, before time is spent on detailed design or development.
- ✅ It provides a clear communication tool for designers, developers, and stakeholders.
- ✅ It ensures that navigation, content hierarchy, and functionality are well thought out from the start.

By focusing on structure rather than style, wireframes help teams build a strong foundation for successful, user-friendly products.
## Key Elements of a Wireframe

A wireframe focuses on the core structure of a page or screen. The following key elements define its purpose and guide the design process:

### 🗂️ Layout Structure
The overall arrangement of components on the page, determining where headers, footers, sidebars, and content areas are positioned.

**Example:**  
A homepage wireframe might use a grid layout where the logo appears at the top left, navigation at the top right, and a hero image spans the top section.

---

### 🧭 Navigation
The menus, links, or buttons that guide users through the system and help them reach their goals efficiently.

**Example:**  
A property booking app wireframe might include a top navigation bar with links to *Search*, *Bookings*, and *Account Settings*.

---

### 📝 Content Placement
Defines where key content, images, text blocks, and CTAs (Call To Actions) appear on the screen.

**Example:**  
A checkout wireframe might position the booking summary on the left side and the payment form on the right side of the page.

---

### ⚙️ Functionality
Outlines how interactive components work, such as buttons, forms, and filters. It shows what user actions are possible and where they occur.

**Example:**  
A search results wireframe may include filter options (e.g., price range, location) on the left panel with real-time results updating on the right.
